# Custom flows

If Clerk's [prebuilt components](/docs/components/overview) don't meet your specific needs or if you require more control over the authentication flow, Clerk enables you to build fully custom sign-up and sign-in flows using our [`useSignUp()`](/docs/references/react/use-sign-up) and [`useSignIn()`](/docs/references/react/use-sign-in) React hooks.

But before diving deep into the code side, it is important to first understand the process behind building sign-up and sign-in flows, which fields are required, and the necessary steps to authenticate a user.

## Sign-up flow

Clerk provides a flexible way to build sign-up flows in your application. You can use a single [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up) object to gather information, verify their email address or phone number, add OAuth accounts, and finally, convert them into a [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user).

Every [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up) has a set of requirements it must meet before it is turned into a [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user). These requirements are defined by the instance settings you selected in the [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/). Once all requirements are met, the [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up) will turn into a new [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user), and an active session for that [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user) will be created on the current [`Client`](/docs/references/javascript/client).

Don't worry about collecting all the required fields at once and passing them to a single request. The API is designed to accommodate a progressive sign-up flow, often corresponding to multi-step sign-up forms.

### Required fields

The [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up) will show the current state of requirement collection. You can consult the `required_fields`, `optional_fields`, and `missing_fields` keys for a hint on where things are and what you need to do next.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `required_fields` | All fields that must be collected before the [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up) converts into a [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user). |
| `optional_fields` | All fields that can be collected, but are not necessary to convert the [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up). |
| `missing_fields` | A subset of `required_fields`. It contains all fields that still need to be collected before a successful [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up). Note that the `missing_fields` will be updated dynamically. As you add more fields to the [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up), they will be removed from `missing_fields`. Once it's empty, your [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up) will automatically convert into a [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user). |

The values of the collected fields are all accessible on the root of the [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up), under their corresponding keys; `email_address` and `phone_number` are examples of such keys.

### Verified fields

Some fields, such as `email_address` and `phone_number`, must be verified before it is fully added to the [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up). Similar to what happens with required fields, the [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up) contains the current state of all verified fields. The keys relative to verification are `unverified_fields` and `verifications`.

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `unverified_fields` | A list of all [`User`](/docs/references/javascript/user/user) attributes that need to be verified and are pending verification. This is a list that gets updated dynamically. When verification for all required fields has been successfully completed, this value will become an empty array. |
| `verifications` | An object that describes the current state of verification for the [`SignUp`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-up/sign-up). There are currently three different keys: `email_address`, `phone_number`, and `external_account`. |

## Sign-in flow

Sign-in's are initiated by creating a [`SignIn`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in) object on the current [`Client`](/docs/references/javascript/client). The [`SignIn`](/docs/references/javascript/sign-in/sign-in) handles all the state and logic associated with a sign-in. If the sign-in is successfully authenticated, it will transform into an active session on the current [`Client`](/docs/references/javascript/client).

### Completing a sign-in

There are 3 main steps a user must perform in order to complete a sign-in.

<Steps>

### Identification

The first step a user needs to make is to identify what account they'd like to sign in to. This is done with an identifier, which can either be an email address, a phone number, or a username.

### Factor one verification

Once a user is identified, they need to prove that "they are who they say they are". This is the process of "authenticating" the user. There's a number of strategies a user can use to perform authentication with the most basic being the humble password. Other authentication strategies, like passwordless sign-in, can be explored in the [sign-in options documentation](/docs/authentication/configuration/sign-in-options). 

### Factor two verification (optional)

This step only applies to users that have turned on two-factor authentication, also known as [multifactor authentication](/docs/custom-flows/mfa), for their user. 

When one form of verification isn't enough, trust two! Forcing two different verification steps vastly increases the security of your account. The most common setup a user will have to protect their account is using a password as their first kind of verification, and a `phone_code` as their second kind of verification.
